# flask-blog-application

## Project Capabilities Overview
* Login with your account, register for a new account.
* Create new posts (as an admin).
* Edit your posts (as an admin & being the author of the post).

## Run The Application Locally
If you want to run this application locally
* Clone the repository 
```git clone https://github.com/mahmouddello/flask-blog-application```
* Want to stick with the current coding?
  * Add a secret key for ```FLASK_KEY``` and database engine url 
as ```DATABASE_URL``` as enviorment variables, for local uses I preffer using [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) since it's pre-downloaded with Python, and the database url
should be like this e.g. : ```sqlite:///dbname.sqlite3``` or ```sqlite:///dbname.db```.

## Finally
Enjoy and have a good time. ðŸ’»ðŸ™Œ
